            <p>
                The word hypertext markup language is composed of the words “hypertext” and “markup language”. 
                The term "hypertext" refers to the linking of text with other documents and “markup language” 
                refers to a language that uses a set of tags.

                <p>Today, I'm writing this tutorial to create a resource that will help you learn HTML in less than 30 days. Here's a recommended timeline for learning HTML, based on your educational background:
                High School students and younger: Around 25 days
                Those beyond High School: Around 20 days
                College students and above: Around 10-20 days
                You may be wondering why I'm discussing these timelines. It's important for me to set expectations before you start your journey of learning HTML with me.
                My name is Harry (the same CodeWithHarry guy from YouTube), and today I'm writing this comprehensive HTML tutorial for all of you. Let's jump right into HTML!</p>

                <H2 style="background-color: lightcoral;">What is HTML?</H2>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. In layman's terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.</p>
                <p>HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites.
                HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet.
                HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically have either a .html or .htm extension.
                There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.</p>

            <div>
                <H2 style="background-color: lightcoral;">Features of HTML</H2>
                <p>It is platform-independent. For example, Chrome displays the same pages identically across different operating systems such as Mac, Linux, and Windows.
            Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page  <br>(For example - YouTube shows videos on their website).
            HTML is a markup language and not a programming language.
            It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc. to show interactive (or dynamic) web pages.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <H2 style="background-color: lightcoral;">Why the Term HyperText & Markup Language?</H2>
                <p>The term 'Hypertext Markup Language' is composed of two main words: 'hypertext' and 'markup language.' 'Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, while 'markup language' denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags.

                Thus, HTML is the practice of displaying text, graphics, audio, video, etc., in a certain way using special tags. <br><br>

                <mark style="background-color: red;">Note</mark>: Tags are meaningful texts enclosed in angle braces, like '<...>'. For example, the '' tag. Each tag has a unique meaning and significance in building an HTML page, and it can influence the web page in various ways.</p>

                <H2 style="background-color: lightcoral;">A beautiful analogy to understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</H2>
                <img src="html intro.png" alt="" height="200" style="background-color: azure;"> <br>
                <p>In building a webpage, think of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as different parts of a car. HTML is like the car's skeleton, forming the basic structure and frame. CSS adds the paint and finishing touches, making the car look appealing with color, style, and design. JavaScript is similar to the engine and mechanical parts, infusing the car with functionality, movement, and interactive features. Similarly, when developing a website, HTML lays out the structure, CSS enhances its visual appeal, and JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic content.</p>
